Mind_Map_overview

The Main purpose of this project is the create a simulation.
More specifically a simulation that will be able to simulate oribits of a circumbinary planet. 

#objectives
The simulation will be made in Matplotlib
The simulation will contain one planet and two orbiting stars 
The only variables that should be changed are the (x,y) velocity and position of the planet 
There should be a gravitational force that attracts the celestial bodies 

#Limitations
The stars each have a mass of 1M (which is the equivilant of 3,955Ã—10^30 kg)
The stars will have a constant velocity
The orbit each the center of mass at the distance of 1 Au (149 597 870 700 m)
