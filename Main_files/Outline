This is the main outline where i will be sorting out my thoughts

1. Create a timer for 1000 steps 
2. A loop that does -1 from the 1000 steps  #done 

3. create a class for a star 
4. give each star the proporties of 
    
    x and y coordinates 
    radius 
    marker 
    color 
    mass 
    
    x and y velocity

5. Define the calculation needed for cacluating the acceleration of a mass (Newton's gravitational law)
6. Use the odient Funciton to return x and y coordinates 
7. use a loop to update the x and y (coordinates and velocity)

Imports needed: 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import math
